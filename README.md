- 👋 Hi, I’m @skiranpasupuleti, newbie to GitHub :)
- 👀 I’m interested in image processing schemes to extrat the volumetric properties of blood cells 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ImageJ to process images to count the cell and get projected surface area
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing the code to differentiate (group) blood cells from whole-blood based on their shape (circularity) and size through image processing
